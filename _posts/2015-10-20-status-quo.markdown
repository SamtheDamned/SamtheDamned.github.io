Somewhere in my bones, I remember a quiet joy

When I smile in silence it pretends it's still alive

Lost in thought, images flash against the canvas in my mind

Painting over everything and leaving memories behind

Living in a hell like this, faking like I know what's going on

With psychosomatic cinema reeling, playing 'til I'm gone


Weary with the ghosts of all those lifetimes marching

We can act like there was nothing to it, but overreaction

Fly the flag of freedom to cover up the false,

but down here we collect the blood dripping down the walls. 

If I fight hard enough can I remove the stains from my soul?

What makes me weak to you is that I've survived at all


All I've got left is shriek and tooth and claw

Struggling against the darkness threatening to swallow

I see everything that's happening, guys

but I'm far behind dark eyes

Far behind, struggling against the lies I've been told

It's just something that happens, you just have to fold

Feels so surreal, like nothing was done

It's all fun and games, until someone gets one


Going through the motions, and all the other sheep

Don't realize that persona's only skin deep

No one wants to dig if they've got to excavate 

So just keep walking, and leave it to fate

But if I were to die tonight, they'd be weeping

Wondering how they didn't know, having trouble sleeping


When you teach her to be selfless, just remember who gets hurt

It won't be the people she supported left lying in the dirt

If money can't buy happiness then why is it that we 

are separated so thickly that we can't even see

They say the grass is greener on the other side

When you've gotta pay to save your soul it's easy to see why


Among us are walking ghosts behind a paywall

Barred from even showing the world who they are

Scream too hard and they'll rip your heart out,

you have to paint your pretty face and fake to find your way out

Always happy, always smiling, 1984

Express your inner turmoil and wage existential war


Show your colors, find a ticket to the prison in your mind

Get out of our sight, you mar the landscape like the rest of your kind

This life's a revolution in of itself

Take down the lies and slander sitting on the shelf

Keep flinging names until one sticks,

in the end, if you disagree it means you're sick

Trying to cure a cancer they brought on themselves

You can buy into the game, you can pay to excel


We are born imperfect and why can't we see

Others are imperfect just like me
